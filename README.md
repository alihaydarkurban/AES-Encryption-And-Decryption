# AES-Encryption-And-Decryption
##### This project is an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 128 bit or 16 byte key values.
***
#### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
AES is a symmetric block cipher algorithm and it uses key to encrypt the message. It has three different key sizes like 128, 192, or 256 bit. In this project, AES 128-bit key was developed. It means that 128-bit or 16-byte messages can be encrypted and decrypted.
***
#### Cipher block chaining (CBC)
CBC is a version of the AES. CBS uses the AES in itself and it can encrypt and decrypt all messages which have more byte than 16.
***
#### Output Feedback (OFB)
OFB is a version of the AES. OFB uses the AES in itself and it can encrypt and decrypt all messages which have more byte than 16.
